CHAPTER XLIII. HARK!


Hist! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?

It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in
a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to
the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the
buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the
hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak
or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the
deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the
steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.

It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
Cholo, the words above.

Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?

Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise dye mean?

There it is againunder the hatchesdont you hear ita coughit
sounded like a cough.

Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.

There againthere it is!it sounds like two or three sleepers turning
over, now!

Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? Its the three soaked biscuits
ye eat for supper turning over inside of yenothing else. Look to the
bucket!

Say what ye will, shipmate; Ive sharp ears.

Aye, you are the chap, aint ye, that heard the hum of the old
Quakeresss knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; youre
the chap.

Grin away; well see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I
suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell
Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the
wind.

Tish! the bucket!
