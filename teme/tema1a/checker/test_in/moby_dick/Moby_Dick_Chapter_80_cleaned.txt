ETYMOLOGY.


(Supplied by a late consumptive usher to a grammar school.)

The pale Usherthreadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him
now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it
somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

ETYMOLOGY

While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what
name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through
ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification
of the word, you deliver that which is not true. _Hackluyt._

WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. _hval_. This animal is named from roundness
or rolling; for in Dan. _hvalt_ is arched or vaulted. _Websters
Dictionary._

WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. _Wallen_;
A.S. _Walw-ian_, to roll, to wallow. _Richardsons Dictionary._

EXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian.)


It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grubworm of a
poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans
and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to
whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the
higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these
extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the
ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these
extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing
birds eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our
own.

So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.
Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too
rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
unpleasant sadnessGive it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains
ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go
thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries
for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with
your hearts; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the
seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel,
Michael, and Raphael, against your coming. Here ye strike but
splintered hearts togetherthere, ye shall strike unsplinterable
glasses!

incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the
bottomless gulf of his paunch. _Hollands Plutarchs Morals_.

The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are:

in length as four acres or arpens of land. _Hollands Pliny_.

Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a
great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the
former, one was of a most monstrous size. * * This came towards us,
open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea
before him into a foam. _Tookes Lucian_. _The True History_.

He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales,
which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he

that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days. _Other or
Octhers verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King Alfred,
A.D._ 890.

And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter

Created hugest that swim the ocean stream. _Paradise Lost_.

swimming in them. _Fullers Profane and Holy State_.

So close behind some promontory lie
    The huge Leviathan to attend their prey,
And give no chance, but swallow in the fry,
    Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way.
_Drydens Annus Mirabilis_.

While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they cut off his
head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it will come; but it
will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water. _Thomas Edges Ten
Voyages to Spitzbergen, in Purchass_.

In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, and in
wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes and vents, which
nature has placed on their shoulders. _Sir T. Herberts Voyages into
Asia and Africa. Harris Coll_.

Here they saw such huge troops of whales, that they were forced to
proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they should run their
ship upon them. _Schoutens Sixth Circumnavigation_.

We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The
Jonas-in-the-Whale. * * *

Some say the whale cant open his mouth, but that is a fable. * * *

They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a whale,

herrings in his belly. * * *

One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in

1671. _Harris Coll_.

Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one
eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was
informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight of
baleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of Pitferren.
_Sibbalds Fife and Kinross_.

Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this

Whales in the sea
Gods voice obey.

To fifty chosen sylphs of special note,
We trust the important charge, the petticoat.
Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,
Tho stuffed with hoops and armed with ribs of whale.
_Rape of the Lock_.

If we compare land animals in respect to magnitude, with those that
take up their abode in the deep, we shall find they will appear
contemptible in the comparison. The whale is doubtless the largest
animal in creation. _Goldsmith, Nat. Hist_.

If you should write a fable for little fishes, you would make them
speak like great whales. _Goldsmith to Johnson_.

In the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but it was
found to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed, and were then
towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves behind the
whale, in order to avoid being seen by us. _Cooks Voyages_.

The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so
great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to
mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood, and
some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to
terrify and prevent their too near approach. _Uno Von Troils Letters
on Bankss and Solanders Voyage to Iceland in_ 1772.

Burke_. (_somewhere_.)

A tenth branch of the kings ordinary revenue, said to be grounded on
the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from pirates
and robbers, is the right to _royal_ fish, which are whale and
sturgeon. And these, when either thrown ashore or caught near the
coast, are the property of the king. _Blackstone_.

Soon to the sport of death the crews repair:
Rodmond unerring oer his head suspends
The barbed steel, and every turn attends.
_Falconers Shipwreck_.

Bright shone the roofs, the domes, the spires,
    And rockets blew self driven,
To hang their momentary fire
    Around the vault of heaven.

So fire with water to compare,
    The ocean serves on high,
Up-spouted by a whale in air,
    To express unwieldy joy.
_Cowper, on the Queens Visit to London_.

Ten or fifteen gallons of blood are thrown out of the heart at a
stroke, with immense velocity. _John Hunters account of the
dissection of a whale_. (_A small sized one_.)

The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the
water-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage
through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood
gushing from the whales heart. _Paleys Theology_.

The whale is a mammiferous animal without hind feet. _Baron Cuvier_.

In 40 degrees south, we saw Spermacetti Whales, but did not take any
till the first of May, the sea being then covered with them.
_Colnetts Voyage for the Purpose of Extending the Spermacetti Whale
Fishery_.

In the free element beneath me swam,
Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle,
Fishes of every color, form, and kind;
Which language cannot paint, and mariner
Had never seen; from dread Leviathan
To insect millions peopling every wave:
Gatherd in shoals immense, like floating islands,
Led by mysterious instincts through that waste
And trackless region, though on every side
Assaulted by voracious enemies,
Whales, sharks, and monsters, armd in front or jaw,
With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.
_Montgomerys World before the Flood_.

Io! Pan! Io! sing.
To the finny peoples king.
Not a mightier whale than this
In the vast Atlantic is;
Not a fatter fish than he,
Flounders round the Polar Sea.
_Charles Lambs Triumph of the Whale_.

In the year 1690 some persons were on a high hill observing the whales
spouting and sporting with each other, when one observed:
therepointing to the seais a green pasture where our childrens
grand-children will go for bread. _Obed Macys History of Nantucket_.

I built a cottage for Susan and myself and made a gateway in the form
of a Gothic Arch, by setting up a whales jaw bones. _Hawthornes
Twice Told Tales_.

She came to bespeak a monument for her first love, who had been killed
by a whale in the Pacific ocean, no less than forty years ago.

No, Sir, tis a Right Whale, answered Tom; I saw his spout; he threw
up a pair of as pretty rainbows as a Christian would wish to look at.
Hes a raal oil-butt, that fellow! _Coopers Pilot_.

Essex of Nantucket, which was attacked and finally destroyed by a large
Sperm Whale in the Pacific Ocean_. _By Owen Chace of Nantucket, first
mate of said vessel. New York_, 1821.

A mariner sat in the shrouds one night,
        The wind was piping free;
Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale,
And the phospher gleamed in the wake of the whale,
        As it floundered in the sea.
_Elizabeth Oakes Smith_.

The quantity of line withdrawn from the different boats engaged in the
capture of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or
nearly six English miles. * * *

Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which,
cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four miles.
_Scoresby_.

Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the
infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head,
and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes
at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with vast
swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed. * * *

It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the
habits of so interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so
important an animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely
neglected, or should have excited so little curiosity among the
numerous, and many of them competent observers, that of late years must
have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities
of witnessing their habitudes. _Thomas Beales History of the Sperm
Whale_, 1839.

The Cachalot (Sperm Whale) is not only better armed than the True
Whale (Greenland or Right Whale) in possessing a formidable weapon at
either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a
disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once
so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as
the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale
tribe. _Frederick Debell Bennetts Whaling Voyage Round the Globe_,
1840.

October 13. There she blows, was sung out from the mast-head.
Where away? demanded the captain.
Three points off the lee bow, sir.
Raise up your wheel. Steady!
Steady, sir.
Mast-head ahoy! Do you see that whale now?
Ay ay, sir! A shoal of Sperm Whales! There she blows! There she
breaches!
Sing out! sing out every time!
Ay Ay, sir! There she blows! therethere_thar_ she
blowsbowesbo-o-os!
How far off?
Two miles and a half.
Thunder and lightning! so near! Call all hands.
_J. Ross Brownes Etchings of a Whaling Cruize_. 1846.

The Whale-ship Globe, on board of which vessel occurred the horrid
transactions we are about to relate, belonged to the island of
Nantucket. _Narrative of the Globe Mutiny_, _by Lay and Hussey
survivors. A.D._ 1828.

Being once pursued by a whale which he had wounded, he parried the
assault for some time with a lance; but the furious monster at length
rushed on the boat; himself and comrades only being preserved by
leaping into the water when they saw the onset was inevitable.
_Missionary Journal of Tyerman and Bennett_.

Nantucket itself, said Mr. Webster, is a very striking and peculiar
portion of the National interest. There is a population of eight or
nine thousand persons living here in the sea, adding largely every year
to the National wealth by the boldest and most persevering industry.
_Report of Daniel Websters Speech in the U. S. Senate, on the
application for the Erection of a Breakwater at Nantucket_. 1828.

moment. _The Whale and his Captors, or The Whalemans Adventures and

you to hell. _Life of Samuel Comstock_ (_the mutineer_), _by his
brother, William Comstock. Another Version of the whale-ship Globe

if possible, to discover a passage through it to India, though they
failed of their main object, laid-open the haunts of the whale.

These things are reciprocal; the ball rebounds, only to bound forward
again; for now in laying open the haunts of the whale, the whalemen
seem to have indirectly hit upon new clews to that same mystic
North-West Passage. _From_ _Something_ _unpublished_.

It is impossible to meet a whale-ship on the ocean without being
struck by her near appearance. The vessel under short sail, with
look-outs at the mast-heads, eagerly scanning the wide expanse around
them, has a totally different air from those engaged in regular
voyage. _Currents and Whaling. U.S. Ex. Ex_.

Pedestrians in the vicinity of London and elsewhere may recollect
having seen large curved bones set upright in the earth, either to form
arches over gateways, or entrances to alcoves, and they may perhaps
have been told that these were the ribs of whales. _Tales of a Whale
Voyager to the Arctic Ocean_.

It was not till the boats returned from the pursuit of these whales,
that the whites saw their ship in bloody possession of the savages
enrolled among the crew. _Newspaper Account of the Taking and
Retaking of the Whale-Ship Hobomack_.

It is generally well known that out of the crews of Whaling vessels
(American) few ever return in the ships on board of which they
departed. _Cruise in a Whale Boat_.

Suddenly a mighty mass emerged from the water, and shot up
perpendicularly into the air. It was the whale. _Miriam Coffin or the
Whale Fisherman_.

The Whale is harpooned to be sure; but bethink you, how you would
manage a powerful unbroken colt, with the mere appliance of a rope tied
to the root of his tail. _A Chapter on Whaling in Ribs and Trucks_.

On one occasion I saw two of these monsters (whales) probably male and
female, slowly swimming, one after the other, within less than a
stones throw of the shore (Terra Del Fuego), over which the beech
tree extended its branches. _Darwins Voyage of a Naturalist_.

Stern all! exclaimed the mate, as upon turning his head, he saw the
distended jaws of a large Sperm Whale close to the head of the boat,
threatening it with instant destruction;Stern all, for your lives!
_Wharton the Whale Killer_.

So be cheery, my lads, let your hearts never fail,
While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!
_Nantucket Song_.

Oh, the rare old Whale, mid storm and gale
    In his ocean home will be
A giant in might, where might is right,
    And King of the boundless sea.
_Whale Song_.
